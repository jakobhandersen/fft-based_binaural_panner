  "description": "Pan audio signals binaurally to a spherical direction specified by interaural-polar coordinates â€“ azimuth and elevation. Performs convolution in the frequency domain based on HRTF inpulse responses from The CIPIC HRTF Database. This version of the panner also includes an mc version (mc.binpan~) that can pan multi-channel signals. The CIPIC HRTF database project page is no longer accessible but GitHub user amini-allight has uploaded the project resources to this repository: https://github.com/amini-allight/cipic-hrtf-database.",
